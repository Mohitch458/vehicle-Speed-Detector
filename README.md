Title: Vehicle Speed Detection System


Description: This project implements a real-time vehicle speed detection system using OpenCV and dlib. It detects and tracks cars in a video, estimates their speed, and displays it on the screen.

Key Features:

Detects multiple vehicles using Haar cascades.
Tracks individual vehicles using correlation trackers.
Estimates speed based on object movement and frame rate.
Displays vehicle speed overlayed on the video.
Saves the output video with speed information.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV library
dlib library
NumPy library
myhaar.xml - your pre-trained car detection model 

Instructions:
Make sure you have the required libraries installed.
Replace 'myhaar.xml' with the path to your car detection model.
Run the script main.py.

Output:
The script will display the video with detected vehicles and their estimated speed.
It will also save an output video outpy.avi with the same information.

Additional Notes:
This is a basic implementation and can be further improved by:
Using a more advanced object detection model.
Incorporating lane detection for more accurate speed estimation.
Implementing various filtering techniques to improve tracking accuracy.
You can adjust the parameters in the script to fine-tune the performance for your specific video.
